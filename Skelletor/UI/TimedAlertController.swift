/// visuals of a system alert controller, but adds the possibility to have it dismissed after a given time out.
///
/// - important: If you want to subclass this controller make sure to call `super.viewDidAppear` and
/// `super.viewWillDisappear` if you want to override it. They control the internal timer. Overriding such methods
/// without calling `super` will override the functionality completely.
