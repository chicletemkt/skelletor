# Skelletor

Skelletor is a small framework with common routines. Its idea is to speed up
development by using generalized components. Those components are based on tasks
that are repeated on every single project like core data preparation and fetches, and so
forth.

This project does not intent to create another layer of software upon Apple's
frameworks, but to provide boiler-plate code so you don't have to worry about it.

## Important

Sometimes improvements offered by Apple may let some Skelletor classes to become
obsolete. Every time an API become so easy to use, a Skelletor class may become
obsolete. When it happens, the class will be marked as obsolete and will disappear on
future library releases.
